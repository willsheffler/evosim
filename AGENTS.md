## Project Overlay
This file defines project-specific context for `evosim`.
Shared workflow/policy comes from:
- `shared/sheffler_standards/docs/AGENTS.base.md`

## Purpose and Audience
This is a homeschool learning project.
Participants:
- Student Judah (13, basic Python, excellent math skills)
- Father/teacher Will (scientist/software engineer)

Primary goals:
- Teach core programming and simulation concepts.
- Have fun building evolving creature simulations together.
- Make scientific observations about simulation results.
- Maintain school-credit-friendly documentation of progress.

## Project Direction
- Build creature simulations in a 2D world (Primer-style experiments).
- Start simple and layer complexity gradually.
- First milestone: a 2D board where creatures move and interact.

## Project-Specific Notes
- Keep implementation beginner-readable for Judah.
- Preserve deterministic defaults to support teaching and reproducibility.
